# Changelog

Release notes for Fabric Switchboard. The release workflow publishes the `## X.Y.Z` section of
this file as the notes of release `vX.Y.Z` ([DISTRIBUTION.md](docs/DISTRIBUTION.md)); the
release pull request renames `Unreleased` to the version. While Windows signing is switched off,
that section must say `windows_authenticode: NOT_SIGNED`. Notes of 0.5.3-beta.1 and earlier are
on their [GitHub releases](https://github.com/passioncode-ai/fabric-switchboard/releases).

## Unreleased

- **Releases are built and signed only in GitHub Actions.** A `vX.Y.Z` tag starts
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` in the protected `release` environment; a member of
  `release-approvers` other than the tag's author approves. macOS: the universal app and CLI are
  signed with the organization's CI Developer ID, the app is notarized and stapled, and the
  standalone CLI is notarized on its own (a bare executable cannot be stapled; the receipt names
  both submissions). Windows: built natively on `windows-latest`, with Azure Artifact Signing
  ready behind `AZURE_SIGNING_ENABLED`, which is off for now. Every file is attested (Sigstore),
  summed in `SHA256SUMS` and signed with the organization's release key (`SHA256SUMS.asc`).
  Building and signing on a laptop remain for debugging and are never published.
- **No team id in the code.** The Keychain trust check reads the team only from
  `SWITCHBOARD_SIGNING_TEAM` at build time (the release environment's `APPLE_TEAM_ID`); a build
  without it is a development build ([KEYCHAIN.md](docs/KEYCHAIN.md)).
- The manual `build-windows.yml` workflow is replaced by the release workflow; a Windows build
  of a commit is a rehearsal on an `-rc` tag.
