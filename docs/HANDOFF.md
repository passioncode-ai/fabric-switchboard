# Fabric Switchboard — start here

**Objective:** a Fabric account workbench for Claude Code/Codex, CLI and macOS/Windows builds. Current extension: capture existing CLI authorization, official console login for additional accounts, Claude Swap import, actual active identity, detailed quota and opt-in rotation.
**Owner:** private `passioncode-ai/fabric-switchboard`, branch `codex/bootstrap`. Observatory and other projects are unchanged.

Read [0.3 account/rotation contract](ACCOUNTS-AND-ROTATION.md) → [research delta](RESEARCH-0.3-IMPORTS.md) → [spec](SPEC.md) → [shared contracts](CONTRACTS.md). Current checks/artifacts: [release evidence](evidence/release-0.3.md). [0.2](evidence/release-0.2.md) and [0.1](evidence/verification.md) reports are historical.

## Completed implementation

- Four original comparator repositories researched at fixed commits; Claude Swap revisited for current capture, backups, live identity and compatible locks.
- Tauri/Rust/TypeScript desktop and native CLI share protected vault, immutable HTTP/SSE request identity, isolated official-login homes and macOS/Windows launch adapters.
- Current Claude/Codex capture, read-only Claude Swap import, provider/pool/account/organization upsert, actual native identity distinct from managed selection. Native context stays vault-only.
- Explicit native Claude activation with lock heartbeat/ownership, identity compare, config preservation and guarded rollback. No process kill or prompt replay.
- Detailed quota/reset windows and generation checks, bounded fair polling/backoff. Ordinary CLI owns OAuth refresh; its newer current generation can be adopted for known profiles.
- Persisted same-provider/pool policies with freshness, enabled/expiry eligibility, threshold/headroom/cooldown and hold reasons. Managed route/cooldown publish atomically. One native Claude policy can be enabled across all pools. Manual choice starts cooldown; disabling policy stops rotation.
- Runtime monitor/cache/CLI/Tauri wiring; [CLI](CLI.md) and [operations](OPERATIONS.md) describe usage and recovery.

Packets and shared API: [PLAN-0.3](PLAN-0.3.md). Branches `codex/v03-core`, `codex/v03-imports`, `codex/v03-ui` integrated by cherry-pick; no unmerged packet code is a prerequisite.

## Decisions and boundaries

Metadata writes schema2 and lazily reads schema1; no destructive downgrade. Secrets never reach renderer/control output, logs or Git. Existing streams keep their identity. Native activation explicitly updates ordinary Claude auth; tests use fixtures. Local identity is a source claim until authenticated provider evidence exists.

Inactive snapshots can expire; recapture/reimport or official login is recovery. No competing refresh grant. Codex file/direct macOS keyring capture is supported; newer secrets/ephemeral stores report unavailable. Other shells' transient overrides cannot be inferred. Native Codex takeover, crash-resumable login IDs, indefinite account pins, quarantine, encrypted cross-device export and automatic updates remain follow-ons.

Signing is separate from notarization. Native Windows and provider acceptance remain separate. Hosted full checks remain nightly only; previous hosted run was billing-blocked before any step.

## Exact next task

Read [0.3 release evidence](evidence/release-0.3.md) for final source SHA, checks and receipts. Pending build fields must be resolved before claiming delivery. Next acceptance: [PA-01](packets/provider-acceptance.md), extended with SCN-018..022: authorized capture/import, quota, native Claude activation and managed A→B next-request behavior, exact CLI versions and bounded request budget. Do not read real auth merely to test without an operator action. Native Windows acceptance needs an available Windows host.

Distribution prerequisite: saved notarytool profile name; resume the retained signed archive per [distribution](DISTRIBUTION.md). Developer ID authorization already exists; no key export. Windows signing needs a separate certificate/service.

## Reproduce and local-only state

```sh
git clone --branch codex/bootstrap git@github.com:passioncode-ai/fabric-switchboard.git
cd fabric-switchboard
npm ci
./scripts/check.sh
cargo build --release --locked -p switchboard-cli
```

Keep dependencies, target/dist/artifacts, research clones, app data, Keychain and all provider homes/credentials outside Git. No Fabric parent submodule pin changed. Pushed source is a handoff; draft assets are engineering artifacts, not evidence of provider/native acceptance. Final push/fresh-checkout receipt belongs in the current release report.
